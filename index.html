        The hamburger (commonly known as a “burger”) most likely first appeared in the 19th or early 20th century.
        The modern hamburger was a product of the culinary needs of a society rapidly changing due to industrialization, 
        the emergence of the working class and middle class and the demand for mass-produced, affordable food that could 
        be consumed outside of the home.

      <!-- <p class="history">
        Considerable evidence suggests the USA was the first country where two slices of bread and a ground beef steak 
        were combined into a "hamburger sandwich" and sold. There is some controversy over the origin of the hamburger 
        because its two basic ingredients, bread and beef, had been prepared and consumed separately for many years in 
        different countries before their combination. Shortly after its creation, the hamburger quickly included all of 
        its currently typically characteristic trimmings, including onions, lettuce, and sliced pickles.
